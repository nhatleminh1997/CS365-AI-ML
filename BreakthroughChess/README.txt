# command line to run on terminal:
# python breakthrough_gaming.py
#
# In the code file, the last lines initialize a game 
# and make 2 AI play with their respective heuristic functions
# 
# start_state = initialState(# rows for board, # columns for board, # rows of pawns for each side)
# playgame(heuristic for player 1, heuristic for player 2, initial state, depth for minimax)
#
# currently available heuristics: evasiveUtility, conquerorUtility, heightisgoalUtility, decideBestUtility
#
# modify output on terminal by commenting/uncommenting lines in the implementation of the playgame function
